How to Execute Your Java Chatbot Application
1. Prerequisites
Before you can run the Java chatbot application, you need to ensure the following:
      Java Development Kit (JDK) is installed on your computer.
      Text editor or IDE to edit your Java code (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, Visual Studio Code, or even Notepad++).
      Command line (Terminal) access for running Java programs (Optional if using an IDE).
2. Install Java Development Kit (JDK)
If you haven't already installed Java, follow these steps:
 -> Windows/macOS/Linux: Download and install the latest JDK from the official Oracle website.
    Follow the installation steps based on your operating system.
    >Once installed, verify by running the following command in your command line or terminal:
    >java -version
    >java version "1.8.0_281"
    >Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_281-b09)
    >Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.281-b09, mixed mode)
3. Compile and Run the Java Chatbot Program
    Follow these steps to compile and run the Java program:
    > Save the Java File:
         ->Create a new file named AIChatBotAPI.java and paste the code you shared into that file.
         ->Open Command Line or Terminal:
    > Navigate to the folder where you saved AIChatBotAPI.java.
     --->cd /path/to/your/java/file
    > Compile the Java Program: Run the following command to compile the Java file into bytecode:
      --->javac AIChatBotAPI.java
This will create a file called AIChatBotAPI.class (this is the compiled version of your program).

Run the Java Program: After compiling, run the program using the java command:
---> java AIChatBotAPI
This will launch your chatbot application in a new window.

4. Using an IDE (Alternative)
If you prefer using an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse, follow these steps:

Create a New Java Project:

Open your IDE and create a new Java project.
Add Your Java Code:

Create a new class in the project and paste the chatbot code into it.
Run the Application:

Click on the "Run" button (usually a green arrow) to execute your chatbot program.
Your IDE will automatically compile and run the Java code.

5. Troubleshooting
Issue: “'javac' is not recognized as an internal or external command”.

Solution: This means Java is not installed correctly or not added to your system's PATH. Follow the installation steps for your operating system again and make sure the JAVA_HOME environment variable is set.
Issue: “Class not found”.

Solution: Ensure that the file is named exactly as the class (AIChatBotAPI.java) and that you are in the correct directory when running the java command.
6. Conclusion
After following these steps, you should be able to execute your Java chatbot program either through the command line or an IDE. If you encounter any issues, refer to the troubleshooting section, and ensure your JDK is properly installed.
